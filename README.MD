# BLE Delta Keyboard

This project aims to create a complementary (delta) bluetooth keyboard providing some keys not available by default on a keyboard.

In my case, learning Spainsh, I wanted to have the classical letters with accents (á,é,í,ó,ú,ñ,ü,Á,É,Í,Ó,Ú,Ñ,Ü,,¿ and ¡).

The electronic part consists in an ESP32 and some capacitive touch buttons.
