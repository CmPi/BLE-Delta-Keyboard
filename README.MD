# BLE Delta Keyboard

This project aims to create a complementary (delta) bluetooth keyboard providing some keys not available by default on a keyboard.

In my case, learning Spainsh, I wanted to have the classical letters with accents (a, e, i, o , u and n).

The electronic part consists in an ESP32 and some capacitive touch buttons.
